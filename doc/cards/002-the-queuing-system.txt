The Queuing System
------------------
The Queuing system is managed on separate nodes (an active/active config to start with). The queuing nodes should not
be used for any other Mir component.

1. Requirements for the queuing system
--------------------------------------
RQUEUE-001: Queues need to be persistent, ideally not a single message is lost
RQUEUE-002: Messages are exchanged in transactions, automatically opened if not already in place and kept open unless specifically closed by client. 
            At transaction close another one is automatically opened. 
            Transaction history needs to be kept by the queuing system and replayed by a consumer if necessary.
            A unique transaction id is used to identify a transaction.
RQUEUE-003: Queues are actually like channels. Different producers can publish messages to a channel and different consumers can take a message at a time from a channel.
RQUEUE-004: Channels are identified by a unique path (as a list of labels). The label separator can be defined.
RQUEUE-005: The queuing system knows how many channels are there and keeps track of the list of producers and consumers connected to a given channel.
RQUEUE-006: Each single channel operation has to be atomic.
RQUEUE-007: If the queuing system is centralized, it has to be accessed by any other node of a Mir system and needs to support HA configurations (active/active)
