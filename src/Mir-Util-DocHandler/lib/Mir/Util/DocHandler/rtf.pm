=head1 NAME

Mir::Util::DocHandler::rtf - Driver class to handle 
RTF documents

=head2 SYNOPSIS

    use Mir::Util::DocHandler;

    my $doc = Mir::Util::DocHandler->create(driver => 'rtf' );

=head2 DESCRIPTION

This driver handles RTF documents, providing methods
for extracting text from them. Due to a lack of modules to handle
this type of documents, the number of pages cannot be determined
and text is extracted from the whole document.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 SUPPORT

You can find documentation for this module with the perldoc command:

    perldoc <module>
