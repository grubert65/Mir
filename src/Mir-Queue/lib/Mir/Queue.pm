=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Mir::Queue ();

    my $q = Mir::Queue->create(
        driver  => 'Redis',
        params  => {
            connect => { server => '127.0.0.1:6379' }, 
            db      => 1,
            key     => 'test'
            timeout => 10,
        });

    # flush queue content...
    $q->flush();

    # push next item in queue...
    $q->push('bar');

    # pop first item in queue or wait (for timeout)
    # for next item...
    $my $item = q->pop();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A very simple class to handle a basic queue. 
Don't use the base class (the interface) but one of the 
implemented drivers.
The interface comes with the Redis driver.
The Redis driver supports multiple producers/consumers, please read
the specific driver implementation details for its features.
